  storyText: "Got to be something around here to help with some smashy smashy. You\r\n
    \   see a crate with all manner of pipes, wires and cogs scattered within it.
    Mostly\r\n    trash.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou could try the brute force approach - wack
    the lock with one\r\n    of the pipes. Or you could take some time to build a
    contraption with some kind\r\n    of leverage, maybe a mini pulley system with
    those wires and the cogs.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow\r\n    to proceed?\\r\\n1. No time to
    waste, grab the pipe, start wacking.\\r\\n2. Take the\r\n    time to build a leverage-gadget."
