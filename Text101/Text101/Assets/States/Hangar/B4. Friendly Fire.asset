  storyText: "You tear off a piece of metal framing from your leather airship pilot\r\n
    \   armour and hold it ready as a shiv of sorts. As the door opens you rush at
    your\r\n    captor, leaping like a crazy person and hollering a primal scream
    of rage.\\r\\n\\r\\nPayback\r\n    time for your beating and from all the pain
    these dirty Festers have caused your\r\n    family. You drive home your metal
    shiv. You hear the crunch of bones and feel\r\n    the slice of flesh. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter
    a brief struggle, there is stillness. You look\r\n    down and see... oh my lord...
    you see... yourself? What? How?\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Continue..."
